                    Alan Turing is a British mathematician and logician who made 
                    many contributions to cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, mathematics, 
                    and mathematical biology 
                    (later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and  artificiallife.)

                Alan has made a drastic change to history. If it wasn't for Alan, there is a possibility    inwhere we would not have defeated the Germans in World War II. The Nazi Germans used anEnigma     machine, a cipher device for a military command to encode strategic messages beforeand during   World War II. Alan was able to decrypt the Enigma code. With the decryption, theAllies were   able to defeat the Nazi Germans.
